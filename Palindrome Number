Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:
-231 <= x <= 231 - 1

 First solution(String-based reversal):
 var isPalindrome = function(x, str = x.toString()) {
    return str === str.split('').reverse().join('')
};

Second solution(Number based reversal):
var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    if(x < 0) return false

    const temp = x
    let reserved = 0

    while(x > 0) {
        reserved = reserved * 10 + x % 10
        x = parseInt(x / 10)
    }

    return temp === reserved
};
